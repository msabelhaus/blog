I'm Margaret, a graduate student in Data Science at **Colorado School of Mines** (completing May 2022). I love all things data and hope to make a career using the intersection of math, computer science, and business to solve interesting problems. 

My particular areas of interest are, but not limited to,
- Machine learning
- Predictive modeling
- Production-ready code development
- Environmental/energy sector data

I graduated from **the Pennsylvania State University** with Bachelor's degrees in Economics and Statistics. Afterwards I worked for two years as a Research Assistant for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, DC. During my time there I worked on various research projects, strengthened the efficiency of the Money Market Analysis section, and taught/helped coordinate a coding course at Howard University with the goal of encouraging minority voices to enter the field of economic policy.

I realized that while economics will always be an interest of mine, my real passion lies in data science and programming. I ended up at Mines, where I have had the opportunity to learn and implement a variety of machine learning techniques. To see some of what I've been working on, see my "POSTS" page.

I live in **Denver, CO**.  Outside of my work I enjoy all things outdoors and making the most of having the mountains right next door. I also love to paint when there's time for it!
